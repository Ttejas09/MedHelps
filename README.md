-   **Feature 1:** (e.g., Patient dashboard)
-   **Feature 2:** (e.g., Appointment scheduling)

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, full-stack architecture:

-   **Frontend:**
    -   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
    -   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
    -   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
-   **Backend:**
    -   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    -   *(Please list Python frameworks used, e.g., Flask, Django, FastAPI)*

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main parts:

-   `/src`: Contains all the frontend code (TypeScript, components, styles).
-   `/backend`: Contains all the backend server code (Python).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
-   [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Ttejas09/MedHelps.git](https://github.com/Ttejas09/MedHelps.git)
    cd MedHelps
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend (Python):**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    # It's recommended to use a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # (Create a requirements.txt file if you don't have one)
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend (TypeScript + Vite):**
    ```sh
    # Install NPM packages
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    source venv/bin/activate
    # (Add the command to run your server, e.g., python app.py or uvicorn main:app --reload)
    ```

2.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    (In a separate terminal)
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port specified by Vite) in your browser to see the application.
